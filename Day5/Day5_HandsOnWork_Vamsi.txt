#1. Password Validation
#Scenario:
#Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a password until the correct password "secret123" is entered. If the user enters the wrong password, print "Try again".
#Which loop structure will you use?

#2. Sum of User Inputs
#Scenario:
#Keep asking the user to input positive numbers and add them to a total sum. Stop when the user enters 0 or a negative number, then display the sum.
#How to check the condition?
#How to keep track of the sum?

#3.Menu with Exit Option
#Create a menu-driven program that shows options continuously until the user chooses to exit (option 4)

#How do you keep the menu running until exit?

#4. Day of the Week
#Ask the user to enter a number from 1 to 7, and print the corresponding day of the week (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday). If the number is out of range, print "Invalid day".

#5. Calculator Operations
#Build a simple calculator that asks the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers, then performs the operation. Use switch-case to decide which operation to perform.
#How to map operators to cases?
#What to do for invalid operators?
